This software is a simple bit of code that intends to make your live as a STC easier. it comes with simple functionality to let you enter ships into the programm, the program then takes care of how long the ship was docked and calculates the fine for you. Lastly it repetadly reminds you every few min(2.5 min by default) if any ships are overparking and how much they owe you.

The program comes with a help command that explains all commands but here is a summery and some examples:<br>
- help -> displays a help screen.<br>
- assign -> takes 2 arguments and assigns the ship to the given dock example "assign.a1.CIV-451" this assigns dock a1 to the ship CIV-451.<br>
- unassign -> unassigns the ship at the given dock example "unassign.a1" would remove CIV-451 from the tracker.<br>
- unassign_name -> unassigns the ship with a given name example "unassign_name.CIV-451" would remove the ship CIV-451 at dock a1 from the tracker.<br>
- print -> prints all current tracked statistics about all ships.<br>
- cls -> clears the console<br>
